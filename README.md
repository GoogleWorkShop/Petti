The best app for dog owners who like to walk with their neighbours

## About the APP

Petti was created in order to let dog owners the opprutinty to know other dog-owners around their geographical position.

The app has two main features:
1. Map-based display of dog owners based on static locations given by the users themselves.
2. Dynamic list display of dog-owners which are near the user - updated in real time.

Additionally, the app has more useful features for dog owners: Food and vaccinations reminders; map display of near parks, pet stores and vets.


## Project structure

The source code - apart from the reources which has its own directory - is devided into two main sub-directories:
1. the "petti" sub-directory which contains all of the app's activities and fragments. These sources essentially represents all of the user-interface code.
2. the "db" sub-directory which contatins both firebase API modles (named "API.java", "ChatApi.java" and "LocationsApi.java") 
   and other database class representations ("owner.java", "Dog.java", and "ChatMessage.java").
